 I'm Edward Kim (김효민, 金曉民). My interests are generally in the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Computation and their intersections with Computer Science. I completed my undergraduate education at [UC Berkeley](https://cs.berkeley.edu/) with degrees in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics. I'm currently at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) where I've worked in topics dealing with **Formal Verification**, particularly those situated within the **Reachability Analysis of Non-linear Dynamical Systems** under [Prof. Parasara Sridhar Duggirala](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~psd/).

 I also learned a bit of Theoretical CS (mostly Complexity Theory) and Quantum Computing from the neighboring [Duke University](https://www.cs.duke.edu/) commuity, where I've had the fortune of learning and receiving guidance from [Prof. Iman Marvian](https://sites.duke.edu/marvian/) in the realm of Quantum Computation and Information.

 I will be joining the [University of Southern California's](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) ECE department as a Ph.D student for Fall 2022.

 I'm currently interested in a wealth of topics in **Quantum Error Correction** and **Quantum Information Theory**, especially their connections to **Topological Quantum Computation**. My current interests belong to topics residing in the fields below:

  - Topological Quantum Codes, especially those arising from Homological invariants.
  - Quantum LDPC Codes
  - Connections between Quantum Information and Complexity Theory
  - Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs)
  - Quantum Algebra and Quantum Topology.
