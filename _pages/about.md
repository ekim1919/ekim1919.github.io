 I'm Edward Kim (김효민, 金曉民). My interests are generally in the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Computation and their intersections with Computer Science. I completed my undergraduate education at [UC Berkeley](https://cs.berkeley.edu/) with degrees in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics. I'm currently at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) where I've worked in topics dealing with **Formal Verification**, particularly those situated within **Reachability Analysis of Non-linear Dynamical Systems**, **Hybrid Automata**, and **Control Theory**, under [Prof. Parasara Sridhar Duggirala](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~psd/).

 I've also had the fortune of learning and receiving guidance from [Prof. Iman Marvian](https://sites.duke.edu/marvian/) in the realm of **Quantum Computation and Information**. I'm currently exploring a wealth of topics in **Quantum Complexity Theory** and **Quantum Information Theory**, especially their connections to **Topological Quantum Computation**. My current interests can be condensed to topics residing in the fields below:

 Quantum Complexity:
  - Quantum Non-local Games.
  - Sum-of-Squares (SoS) in Quantum Information and their connections to Unique Games.
  - Quantum PCPs.

Quantum Information Theory:
  - Topological Quantum Codes, especially those arising from Homological invariants.
  - Topological Entanglement Theory.
  - Representation-theoretic techniques in Quantum Information Theory.

Besides the above, I have hobby interests in Pure Math, Machine Learning, Homebrew/Retro Computing, Cryptography, and Type Theory.
