 I'm Edward Kim (김효민, 金曉民). My interests are generally in the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Computation and their intersections with Computer Science. I completed my undergraduate education at [UC Berkeley](https://cs.berkeley.edu/) with degrees in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics. I'm currently at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) where I've worked in topics dealing with the **Formal Verification of Non-linear Dynamical Systems**, **Counterexample Generation of Autonomous Systems**, and **Control Theory** under [Prof. Parasara Sridhar Duggirala](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~psd/).

 I've also had the fortune of learning and receiving guidance from [Prof. Iman Marvian](https://sites.duke.edu/marvian/) in the realm of **Quantum Computation and Information**. I'm currently exploring a wealth of topics in

  * Quantum Complexity Theory  
  * Quantum Information Theory
  * Topological Quantum Computation

Besides the above, I have hobby interests in Pure Math, Machine Learning, Homebrew/Retro Computing, Hobby Electronics, Financial Markets, Cryptocurrencies, and Type Theory.
