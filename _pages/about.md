 I'm Edward Kim (김효민, 金曉民). My interests are generally in the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Computation and their intersections with Computer Science. I completed my undergraduate education at [UC Berkeley](https://cs.berkeley.edu/) with degrees in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics. I'm currently at [UNC Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) where I've worked in topics dealing with **Formal Verification**, particularly those situated within **Reachability Analysis of Non-linear Dynamical Systems**, **Hybrid Automata**, and **Control Theory**, under [Prof. Parasara Sridhar Duggirala](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~psd/). I will be joining the [University of Southern California's](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) ECE department as a first year Ph.D student for Fall 2022.
 

 I've also had the fortune of learning and receiving guidance from [Prof. Iman Marvian](https://sites.duke.edu/marvian/) in the realm of **Quantum Computation and Information**. I'm currently exploring a wealth of topics in **Quantum Error Correction** and **Quantum Information Theory**, especially their connections to **Topological Quantum Computation**. My current interests belong to topics residing in the fields below:


  - Topological Quantum Codes, especially those arising from Homological invariants.
  - Quantum LDPC Codes
  - Topological Quantum Order, Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs)
  - Connections between Condensed Matter, Quantum Information, and Complexity Theory
