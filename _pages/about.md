 I'm Edward Kim (김효민, 金曉民). My interests are generally in the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Computation and their intersections with Theoretical Computer Science. I am currently at the [University of Southern California's](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/) ECE department as a second-year Ph.D student advised by [Ben Reichardt](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~breichar/).

 I completed my undergraduate education at [UC Berkeley](https://cs.berkeley.edu/) with degrees in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics with Honors. I received my Masters from [UNC Chapel Hill](https://cs.unc.edu/) where I've contributed to topics dealing with Formal Verification, particularly those situated within the Reachability Analysis of Non-linear Dynamical Systems, under [Prof. Parasara Sridhar Duggirala](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~psd/).

 I also learned a bit of Theoretical CS (mostly Complexity Theory) and Quantum Computing from the neighboring [Duke University](https://www.cs.duke.edu/) community, where I've had the fortune of learning and receiving guidance from [Prof. Iman Marvian](https://sites.duke.edu/marvian/) in the realm of Quantum Computation and Information.

 I'm generally interested in topics in **Quantum Error Correction**, **Quantum Information Theory**, and **Quantum Complexity Theory**. I also like their intersections with **Topological Quantum Computation** and **Condensed Matter Theory**. I'm currently exploring some topics in:  
  - Topological Quantum Codes
  - Quantum LDPC Codes
  - Topological Quantum Phases, TQFTs.
  - Quantum Pseudo-randomness, Quantum Expanders
