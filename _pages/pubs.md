## Expositions

(*)-WIP

### Computational Complexity

* [Unique Games and connections to Quantum Complexity](https://github.com/ekim1919/Research/blob/master/Complexity/UGC/ugc.pdf)       
Currently writing as a supplement to the Analysis on Boolean Functions class (Duke COMPSCI 590). An exposition on the Unique Games Conjecture, The PCP Theorem, and some connections to Quantum Complexity and Information. Specific attention is given to topics with overlaps in Hypercontractivity, Non-local Games, and the Quantum PCP Conjecture.

* [On the Fourier Analysis of Boolean Functions and the Linial-Mansour-Nisan Theorem](https://github.com/ekim1919/Research/blob/master/Complexity/LMNTheorem/paper.pdf)  
  Written as final project for Circuit Complexity class (Duke CPS 590).

### Quantum Information

* [Random Local Quantum Circuits as Unitary 2-designs](https://github.com/ekim1919/Research/blob/master/QIT/2Designs/final.pdf)  
    An annotation and review of _Random quantum circuits are approximate 2-designs,_ by Aram W. Harrow and Richard A. Low. The final result of a directed reading conducted during the Spring 2020 semester (Duke PHYS 791).

* [On the Schur-Weyl Duality and its Role in Quantum Information](https://github.com/ekim1919/QuanInformation/blob/master/SchurWeyl/final.pdf)  
  An exposition of the Schur-Weyl Duality and its role in seminal proofs found in Quantum Information Theory. The final project for Quantum Information Theory class (Duke PHYS 590). The notes are still in the process of being extended as I learn more about representation-theoretic techniques used in QIT.

* *[Quantum Expanders and their Applications]({% link files/QEProposal.pdf %})  
  Notes on the definitions of Quantum Expanders and their tensor-product counterparts with specific attention to applications in Quantum Information Theory. Applications include Hastings' study of the entanglement entropy of some gapped one-dimensional systems and Quasirandom Quantum Channels. These notes are created to prepare for a reading group on QIT during the Spring 2022 semester.

### Mathematics

* [Cohomology of Connected Compact Lie Groups](https://github.com/ekim1919/Research/blob/master/LieGroups/CohomologyofLG/cohom.pdf)
